About Me
======
Data generation occurs everywhere regardless of the industry. As a result, I became intrigued with the various potential applications that data can have, especially in the business industry, which base many decisions on the data of the corporation and others that affect its services.

Through various courses and self-teachings, I have picked up SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI skills. I enjoy problem-solving, whether it be mathematical, business-oriented, or The New York Times Games. Recently, I have ventured from working on the basics to creating projects and solving problems with online challenges using these skillsets.

In my free time, my go-to hobbies include reading books (from fantasy to any topic I get curious about) and drawing creative inspirations that strike my brain. I also enjoy keeping myself in shape by venturing to the nearby gym and running in parks.
